## Challenges
The biggest hurdle was implementing the Google Maps API to our site.  Despite the several difficulties it presented during development, it was vital to our team to solve due to the benefits it would provide to our clients.

In addition, our database schema design was more complex than any we have encountered thus far.  Specifically, the use of composite keys added additional challenges, but once we were able to successfully implement them, it became clear why they enable easier implementation of complex schemas and site designs.  

## Lessons Learned

During the course of this project, our team was able to overcome hurdles that provided us with good insight going forward as junior developers.  First, we were able to demonstrate how a team of four developers were able to complete a useful, functional website that can help improve the lives of several people in need.  The fact that we were able to do so with team members located in three different countries and three different time zones was a fascinating part of the experience.  

Additionally, while we are proud of the final product we have made, we understand there is much room for improving the overall functionality for the site.  Throughout the course of our application development - and perhaps mostly during the product testing phase - we were able to make a list of additional functionality we would like to implement in future versions of the application.  Integrating transportation services of food and people, disease prevention practices and alerts, and integrated communication between donors, volunteers, and recipients are at the top of that list.
